With the document open, choose "File" from the top left, and then "Print" from the menu. 

Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + P`.

You'll see an option labeled "Print on both sides of paper". Select this.

In most cases you'll select "Flip on long edge". This simply means that when you flip the paper over the other side
 will continue on the longest side of the paper (imagine you're reading a book). 
 
If you're printing something you read by turning the page vertically (imagine you're looking through a calendar) then
"Flip on short edge" is the option for you. If you're not sure then try printing a single page.

You're now ready to print your document! ðŸ˜Š
