title: Printing an Excel sheet

With the document open, choose "File" from the top left, and then "Print" from the menu. 

Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + P`.

#### Changing the Orientation

In some cases you might have a sheet with more columns than rows. In this example our print preview shows us that
 only the rows up to "I" will be printed, and everything after that will be on a separate sheet.

To give us some more horizontal room, we can print in landscape mode. From the print dialog choose the orientation
 dropdown.

 "Portrait Orientation" means the short side of the paper will be at the top, and "Landscape Orientation
 " means that the long side of the paper will be at the top. In this case we have a sheet with many columns so we
  choose "Landscape Orientation".

When we select this we can see from the preview that we can now print up to column "L".

#### Printing on Both Sides

You'll see an option labeled "Print on both sides of paper". Select this.

![Double Sided](/images/excel_double_sided.png)

In most cases you'll select "Flip on long edge". This simply means that when you flip the paper over the other side
 will continue on the longest side of the paper (imagine you're reading a book). 
 
If you're printing something you read by turning the page vertically (imagine you're looking through a calendar) then
"Flip on short edge" is the option for you. If you're not sure then try printing a single page.
