#### Printing Multiple Slides Per Page

If you have easy-to-read slides it's often not necessary to use a single page for each slide. For clear slides you can
 print many slides on each page and save a lot of paper.
 
From the print dialog, under the "Settings" list of options you can choose the number of slides per page. Choose an
 option that fits your presentation. If you're not sure how many will suit your presentation try printing a test page.

In this example we've chosen six slides per page, which we can see in the updated print preview.

#### Printing On Both Sides

You'll see an option labeled "Print on both sides of paper". Select this.

In most cases you'll select "Flip on long edge". This simply means that when you flip the paper over the other side
 will continue on the longest side of the paper (imagine you're reading a book). 
 
If you're printing something you read by turning the page vertically (imagine you're looking through a calendar) then
"Flip on short edge" is the option for you. If you're not sure then try printing a single page.

You're now ready to print your document! ðŸ˜Š
